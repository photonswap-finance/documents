## Introduction

Photonswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX), providing liquidity and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on Cronos Chain.

Photonswap works with the same automated market-making (AMM) model as Uniswap which is a game changing tech. Automated market makers allow digital assets to be traded without permission and automatically by using liquidity pools instead of a traditional market of buyers and sellers.

Photonswap features a native governance token called PHOTON.
