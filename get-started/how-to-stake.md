# How to use Staking

Staking, lets you earn PHOTON or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with Photonswap's Yield Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually PHOTON.

## **Getting started with Staking staking**

1\. Go to the Stake page [here](https://photonswap.finance/#/stake).

2\. Connect to your Cronos Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Staking you want to stake in.

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Approve** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Approve button should now be replaced with **Deposit**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

7\. Type in an amount or slide the rabbit to choose how much PHOTON you want to stake.

8\. Click **Confirm**. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

9\. The Confirm button will change to \*\*"\*\*Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Staking. Auto PHOTON will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other Stake will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing PHOTON from a pool** \*\*\*\*

You can easily add more PHOTON to a Staking, or move some PHOTON to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked PHOTON.

1\. Click the **Withdraw** to take some PHOTON out of a pool, or the **Deposit** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto PHOTON pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **Deposit**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **Withdraw**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

3\. Click **Confirm**.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
